- Track large datasets and maintain full reproducibility of code and data.

### 🔁 CI/CD Pipelines & Automation
- **Jenkins**, **GitHub Actions**, **GitLab CI/CD**, **ArgoCD**, **CircleCI**
- Automate the entire machine learning (ML) lifecycle, from data ingestion to deployment.

### ☁️ Cloud & Infrastructure
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, **Minikube**, **Google Cloud Run**, **Kubernetes**
- Build scalable and portable infrastructure for training and deployment.

### 📦 Deployment & Containerization
- **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **FastAPI**, **Flask**
- Package and deploy applications reliably across different environments.

### 🏗️ Data Engineering & Feature Storage
